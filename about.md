__EDIT / 2017 :__ Salut, je suis actuellement disponible à l'embauche (!)
&ndash; uniquement sur l'Île de la Réunion
&ndash; ok pour du télé-travail et/ou du _freelancing_
&ndash; ok pour des contrats courts quoique sous conditions, en particulier de
faisabilité “sans compromis”.

Hi, I'm Fabien, sort of a computer nerd who lives in Reunion Island
(Indian Ocean, France territory).

I have about 7+ years of experience in developing web applications in PHP,
including the maintenance of legacy codes, and porting stuff to Symfony 2.

I'm _okay_ when it comes down to Linux: like writing shell scripts, administering
hosts, and all the rest of it.

I also like coding in C/C++, and specifically “systems programming”.

__2017:__ Currently learning [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) & “full JavaScript”
web development
&ndash; looked at [Electron](https://electronjs.org) for building desktop apps
and the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) platform for mobile apps
&ndash; been doing some C++ hacking on Clang, dropped it out of boredom
&ndash; investigating the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) as a replacement for
my C & C++ in my errands in low-level “systems” programming language.

__2016-09:__ I'm leaving [Cines](http://www.cines.fr/) :-|
&ndash; had a very good time there &ndash; good luck and godspeed, I'll miss you guys...
