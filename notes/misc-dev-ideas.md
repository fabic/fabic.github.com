### Quick serve directories with .html

For serving e.g. Doxygen-generated documentation. I'd like to have a command that would basically serve a folder with HTML in it, like :

```bash
$ quickserve ~/dev/some-project/doc/Doxygen/html/ ~/dev/other-project/doc/html
```

As an added bonus it may be able to process lightweight markup language like Markdown or reStructuredText or whatever.
