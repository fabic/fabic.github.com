## The Hero with a Thousand Faces (Joseph Campbell)

> In laying out the monomyth, Campbell describes a number of stages or steps
> along this journey. __(1)__ The hero starts in the ordinary world, and
> receives a call to enter an unusual world of strange powers and events (a
> call to adventure). __(2)__ If the hero accepts the call to enter this
> strange world, the hero must face tasks and trials (a road of trials), and
> may have to face these trials alone, or may have assistance. At its most
> intense, the hero must survive a severe challenge, often with help earned
> along the journey. __(3)__ If the hero survives, the hero may achieve a great
> gift (the goal or "boon"), which often results in the __discovery of
> important self-knowledge__. __(4)__ The hero must then decide whether to
> return with this boon (the return to the ordinary world), often facing
> challenges on the return journey. __(5)__ If the hero is successful in
> returning, the boon or gift may be used to improve the world (the application
> of the boon).
