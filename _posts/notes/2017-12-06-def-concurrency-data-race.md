A data race is a particular type of race condition in which these three
behaviors occur [[Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html)]:

* Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
* At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
* Thereâ€™s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.
