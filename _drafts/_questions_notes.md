* Find files and count different file extensions.


## Notes

### Booleans, power-of-two arithmetic

* `N & ~0x3` truncates the number to a multiple of `4`.
  And `N & 3` wound be the remainder of `N ÷ 4`.


## Ideas

* “Framework” (or virtual file-system) for treating a bunch of files as one
  contiguous stream of characters.

## Other
