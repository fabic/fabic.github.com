* Find files and count different file extensions.


## Notes

### Booleans, power-of-two arithmetic

* `N & ~0x3` truncates the number to a multiple of `4`.
  And `N & 3` wound be the remainder of `N ÷ 4`.


## Ideas

* “Framework” (or virtual file-system) for treating a bunch of files as one
  contiguous stream of characters.

* Code-compile-run trial'n'error – have a tool based on that `hack_cxa_throw_exception.cpp`
  thing you wrote :
    - ...

* How to use C++... as Bash or Python for "writting scripts" ? — in a similar way
  that Symfony's Process component works, so to speak.
