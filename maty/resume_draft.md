As a developer, i closely work with the lighting and compositing department to develop an inhouse tool, who mainly act as a precompositing software and project manager.

As a lighting / compositing artist, i was in charge of masters/whole sequences on animated feature films under Maya with Arnold, 3Delight, Nuke and Fusion.

Try to apply Thomas Gordon and Marshall B. Rosenberg's principles ^_^
